# multiss
In 1998, I made my first software sale: Multi-Screen Saver, a collection of
graphic displays that appeared in Softdisk PC #138, an on-disk magazine for
DOS users. The original program was developed in QuickBASIC and then ported
to C for speed.

Just for fun, I decided to translate some of these old visualizations into
Processing 3 sketches. In some cases (most notably the fireworks program), I
have also made some enhancements.
